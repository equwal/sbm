Manage bookmarks with dmenu and a basic file.

For example:

https://equwal.com  Spenser Truex's website.

And interact with this file using the dmenu script.

== Scripts ==
bm      search & copy, add, or edit a bookmark. Incomplete.
bmks    the old version from somewhere. Will be removed soon.
== Install ==
Requirements: xclip, dmenu, make
1) Export the $BOOKMARKS variable containing the location of the
bookmarks. I like to use ~/.local/share/sbm to store my config.
    mkdir -p ~/.local/share/sbm/
    ~/.bashrc
        export BOOKMARKS="~/.local/share/sbm/bookmarks"
2) define your tag choices in USERTAGS and export that too. The file syntax is:

    <tag><space><description><newline>

    See the included usertags file for an example.

    ~/.bashrc
        export USERTAGS="~/.local/share/sbm/usertags"

3) make install

== Usage ==
Execute

search-term is an extended regex for grep.\n\nBookmark lines are Tab Separated Values\n"
URL<tab>description\n"

The bookmarks can be converted from the web browser formats using
